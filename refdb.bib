	abstract = {Urban spatial structure affects many aspects of urban functions and has implications for accessibility, environmental sustainability, and public expenditures. During the urbanization process, a careful and efficient examination of the urban spatial structure is crucial. Different from the traditional approach that relies on population or employment census data, this research exploits the nighttime light (NTL) intensity of the earth surface recorded by satellite sensors. The NTL intensity is represented as a continuous mathematical surface of human activities, and the elemental features of urban structures are identified by analogy with earth's topography. We use a topographical metaphor of a mount to identify an urban center or subcenter and the surface slope to indicate an urban land-use intensity gradient. An urban center can be defined as a continuous area with higher concentration or density of employments and human activities. We successfully identified 33 urban centers, delimited their corresponding boundaries, and determined their spatial relations for Shanghai metropolitan area, by developing a localized contour tree method. In addition, several useful properties of the urban centers have been derived, such as 9\% of Shanghai administrative area has become urban centers. We believe that this method is applicable to other metropolitan regions at different spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Much research has suggested that night-time light (NTL) can be used as a proxy for a number of variables, including urbanization, density, and economic growth. As governments around the world either collect census data infrequently or are scaling back the amount of detail collected, alternate sources of population and economic information like NTL are being considered. But, just how close is the statistical relationship between NTL and economic activity at a fine-grained geographical level? This paper uses a combination of correlation analysis and geographically weighted regressions in order to examine if light can function as a proxy for economic activities at a finer level. We use a fine-grained geo-coded residential and industrial full sample micro-data set for Sweden, and match it with both radiance and saturated light emissions. We find that the correlation between NTL and economic activity is strong enough to make it a relatively good proxy for population and establishment density, but the correlation is weaker in relation to wages. In general, we find a stronger relation between light and density values, than with light and total values. We also find a closer connection between radiance light and economic activity, than with saturated light. Further, we find the link between light and economic activity, especially estimated by wages, to be slightly overestimated in large urban areas and underestimated in rural areas.},

	abstract = {In Bangladesh, cities are conventionally classified based on population size and revenue collection. This conventional city classification system neglects the spatial characteristics inherit in cities. Providing a more comprehensive city classification system is essential for the country’s future budget allocation and infrastructure development. Five spatial features: city size (area), urban form (AWMPFD), the ratio of built-up and non-built-up areas, urban growth rate, and total night lights intensity for 331 cities of Bangladesh are derived from remote sensing data. This study classifies these cities into six classes using a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on five selected spatial characteristics. The six categories are named for their levels of spatial development, with Cluster 1 being the highest level and Cluster 6 being the lowest level. The share of employment in the primary sector (agriculture) gradually rises from Cluster 1 to Cluster 6. In contrast, the employment share of the service sector follows a reverse trend from Cluster 2 to Cluster 6. Both per capita income and expenditure is higher for the large cities of Cluster 2 than for the metropolitans of Cluster 1. Comparisons across the six classes with non-spatial attributes validate the classification system. Findings also reveal that remote sensing derived spatial information can explain non-spatial characteristics of cities. Therefore, remote sensing derived spatial attributes of cities can be used for city classification where census data are scarce.},

	abstract = {Cities are being restructured as a result of globalization, information flows, and changing economic processes. Global cities become command and control centers for subordinate production centers, resulting in the transformation of the mega-metropolitan system from monocentric to polycentric. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the urban transformation of the Dhaka region, Bangladesh. We estimated urban areas using remote sensing techniques and nighttime light data analysis. The urban areas were extracted from VIIRS nightlight datasets using ISODATA clustering algorithm. Urban areas were examined for two periods, from 2012 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2022. Apart from visual examination, the extracted urban areas were validated through the use of random sample points. Urban transformation was determined using hotspot analysis and the differentiation index for urban expansion. The finding is that Dhaka has continued to grow due to the continuous population growth and industrial centers’ proximity. Secondly, the majority of physical expansion of the Dhaka region occurs along major arterial highways and shows a functional intra-regional decentralization of industrial agglomeration.},

	abstract = {This paper uses a harmonized dataset of annual nightlights to predict district-level GDP for the 64 districts of Bangladesh from 1992 to 2020. The premise of the paper originates from the work of Henderson et al. (2012), who assert that a simple constant elasticity relationship encapsulates the link between nightlights and GDP, with the former being dependent on the latter. Initially, we follow Henderson et al. (2012) to estimate sectoral nightlight elasticities for Bangladesh as a whole. However, not all nightlights contribute to GDP; hence, we only use nightlights emitted by enterprises. Additionally, we incorporate the elasticity of sectoral night- lights to get a measure of nightlight that incorporates the productive nature of value addition to GDP. Our approach to estimating district-level GDP yields a prediction error of 22.24\%, which is smaller than previous estimates. Furthermore, we estimate a composite measure of GDP for Bangladesh and the 64 districts that is devoid of measurement error. We use this composite measure of GDP to estimate the true structural sectoral nightlight elasticities. Lastly, we ad- dress the long-standing debate on the differing economic progress of the eastern and western regions of Bangladesh using nightlights and predicted district GDP.},

The Day-Night Band (DNB) NTL data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) as well as Google Maps highways road data (RD) were used in this research. In order to analyze the correlation between VIIRS NTL and RD for two least developed countries, we performed the Chi-square test of independence, which revealed that the variables are dependent on one another. Following that, we computed the Cramer’s V test as a correlation coefficient to determine the strength of the association for both countries. Our findings revealed a correlation value of 0.334 in Bangladesh and a correlation value of 0.299 in Rwanda, demonstrating that VIIRS NTL and RD are strongly correlated. Following the discovery of a statistically significant correlation, we utilized the data to do more exploratory analysis.},

Unavailability of the traditional gross domestic product (GDP) for subnational areas and building on findings of recent luminosity literature, we use night lights intensity as a proxy for local economic activity to test the convergence hypothesis. Our results show the existence of both absolute and conditional convergence in night lights intensity, but with a very long half-life of convergence. Moreover, the results also indicate sigma divergence. Together, these findings suggest that regional disparity is persistent and wide across Bangladesh's 544 upazilas (subdistricts). There is evidence that lagging upazilas are catching up with the better off ones, but many are also converging with their neighbors or peers (a phenomenon known as “club convergence”). Overall, consistent with the evidence from studies on regional inequality in Bangladesh, our results also indicate that there is an “east-west” divide in luminosity across the subnational units in Bangladesh.},
